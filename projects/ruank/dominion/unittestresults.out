----------------- Testing function: shuffle ----------------

TEST 1: Player number invalid (-1) 
shuffle state = -1, expected = -1

TEST 2: Shuffle results in same number of cards 
deckCount[player] state = 5, expected = 5

TEST 3: Zero cards the player's deck 
shuffle state = -1, expected = -1

TEST 4: Make sure the cards are shuffled 
shuffle state = 0, expected = 0
